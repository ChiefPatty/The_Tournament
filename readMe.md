## Roadmap

### 1. Improved Game Balancing

The biggest focus of change going forward will be how the game is balanced. In certain areas the game is unfair or too easy that make playing the game too thoughtless. First change will be opponent generation to be improved to match player level.

### 2. Save/Load Functions

Save and load functions will be added to allow the player to store progress so a game can be reloaded at a later time

### 3. Item Upgrades/Destruction

In future iterations of the game, weapons and armor will degrade after continuous abuse in fights (on a hit to hit basis) so the player is required to keep a changing arsenal of weapons. Each weapon will have a randomly generated durability value at the start that will determine how many hits it could last and how much the weapons will be valued at.

### 4. More Functional Ship

One key focus of the game will be to have the ship function as a base for collectibles and an opponent record
